# Bacterial Genetics (contd..)

### Hfr (High frequency recombination)

- Ocurs due to the integration of F plasmid into the chromosomal DNA of the cell.
  - This integration is a homologous recombination where homologoug genes from both the specimens are exchanged. Resulting into chromosomal dna with plasmid segment integrated wothin.
  - **regions with homology are transposable.**
- Due to this integration, there is a possibility that donor's entier DNA gets transfered to the recipient cell.
- Hence, the phrase- "HFR". Due to the possible tranfer of more than just the F factor in case of Hfr, higher frequency of recombinant recipients are possible.
- Hfr X F- resulting into F+ is highly unlikely, unlike F+ X F-, where most of the F- gets converted into F+.

### Interupted mating

During conjugation, sometimes incomplete tranfer of genetic material could happen due to interuption. Regarding the same, following are some observations and reated interpretation-

- **Each allele appears in the recipient after a certain time after mating begins:**
- **Donor alleles appear in specefic sequence:** 
  -  In conjugation, copying starts from a specefic location (now to be known as the origin) in the plasmid/Hfr.
  - Origin is located within the F factor.
- **Later alleles are in less number in the recipient:** 
  - This shows that farther genes are tranfered later and till the time conjugation reaches to the end of the Hfr in most of the cell, the interuption occurs.
  - This interuption can be laveraged for genetic maping.

### F' plasmid

- F plasmid which has a a small chromosomal DNA sequence too.
- Results from improper excision of F segment from Hfr strain.
- Suppos that chromosomal gene with F plasmid is lac, then F' is named as F' lac plasmid.
- The recipient of such plasmids becomes diploid for that gene. Such bacteria are called Merozygotes.

## Transformation

### Discovery of tranformation(Griffith's experiment)

- Two stains of species *S. pneumonia* were taken- Rough(R) and Smooth(S).
- When mouse was infected by S, it died, but not by R
- S was heat fixed and mixed with R. 
- When infected by this R + fixed S mixture, mouse died.

**Interpretation:** The genotype of R was somehow tranformed to that of S. That's why R strain was able to kill the mouse.

### Transformation

- Process of uptaking foreign DNA from the surrounding. Performed by bacteria.
- The foreign DNA can be from the dead cells (from same or other species) or can be secreted by the other live bacteria.
- Uptaking of DNA in this manner can tranform the genotype of that bacteria in case when that DNA is of different genotype.

### Steps to tranformation

- DNA binding complexed binds free pDNA fromthe surrounding.
- While it is pulled inside, one strand is degraded enzymetically.
- This/derivative incoming DNA strand may incorporate in the genome on homologous basis.

## Transduction

- Process by which a phage transfers one's genetic material to the other cell is called transduction.
- Discovery was done using good 'ol U tube. Same as used by Bernard Davies in his experiment for proving that conjugation requires physical contact.
- In the experiment, recombinant strains were discovered inspite of small sized pores. 
- Pore size was varied and phages were isolated.

### Generalised Transduction

- When a phage infects a bacteria, it degrades the host genome and starts copying its own dna and starts making its ows components using the bacterial machinery. Once done, the each viral component starts to assemble. In the process,  by mistake, the viral head may encapsulate a segment of bacterial genome of size comparable to the viral genome. After lysing the cell, if this virus which has bacterial genome, infects another bacteria and hence transfers other bacteria's gene(s) to that, then this is called generalised tramsduction.

  - > Tl;dr: If after lysis, a virus with a segment of bacterial dna which it took up mistakenly during its stay in its previous host, infects another bacteria with that genome, then its generalsied transduction.

  

### Cotransduction

- If the encapsulated bacterial DNA segment happened to have more than one genes, they are said to be cotransducted.
- Closer the genes in the original genome, more the chance that they would cotransduce.
- By analysing the frequency of cotransduction of different genes, genetic map can be constructed out of it.

> **Immuned lysogen**: If a superinfecting phage infects a lysogen producing the cognate cI protein that can bind to the OL and OR sites of the incoming phage, as soon as the phage enters the cell the  repressor protein  made in the lysogen will turn off gene expression  from the incoming phage so no plaque will result -- that is, the lysogen is "immune" to the superinfecting phage. [Source](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/phage/immunity.html) 

### Crosses of various prophages

- **Hfr(y) x F- (non immune):** Non immune lysogen---> lysis **zygotic induction**
- **Hfr(y) x F- (immune/y):** immune lysogen---> no lysis

### Secialised Induction

> **Temperate phages**. A bacteriophage that displays lysogenic life cycle in contrast to virulent **phage** that does not have the ability to display lysogeny (especially following mutation). Supplement. Many **temperate phages** are capable of integrating their genome into the genome of their host.

- In such type of tranduction, the transducer (temperate phage) picks up a prt of neighbouring genes of the host genome and leaves some parts of its own genome when it goes through excision process.

- For example, yphage excision may get *gal* gene as it lies near its prophage site, and leave a comparable portion of itself behind. As a result, the **y** **d**efected **gal** gene is called **ydgal**. 

  - > (Î»dgal *;* meaning a defective lambda that carries  *gal*)

- It is called specialised transduction as it is specialised transducer of this *ydgal* gene.
